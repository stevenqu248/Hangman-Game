					<p>Instructions: Begin the game by pressing the "Begin Game!" button. When the game begins, you will be presented with a hidden word or phrase. By pressing keys on the keyboard, guess what it might be. Possible guesses include any letter: a-z. A wrong guess will draw a portion of your character on the stocks. After the character has been completely drawn on the stocks, you will lose. If you guess all the correct letters before being fully drawn, you will win. Whether you win or lose, press the button marked "Replay!" to try again. Caution: Avoid typing too fast or the letter you guessed won't be accepted.</p>
